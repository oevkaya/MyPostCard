## About Me

I am University Teacher in Statistics at the School of Mathematics, at the University of Edinburgh, and a part-time lecturer TED University. Previously, I held postdoc positions at Padova University (2021) and KU Leuven (2020), after completing my PhD at Middle East Technical University in 2018.

Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on copulas and its applications, statistical methods for insurance and environment. I have a certain level of R skills and novice learner for Python programming. I am ambitious about improving my statistical learning skills by leading/organizing/being a part of training workshops.
